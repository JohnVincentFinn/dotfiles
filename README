These are the dotfiles that I use

 `|- .public            - files that should be shared on github
  |- .local             - files that should not be shared because of machine specific settings
 |- global              - should be sourced to get the locations of the other dotfiles
 |- link                - files that should be linked to the ~ directory

scripts
-------
contains configure.files which should be run on new syncs (when it's done)
This directory should be pointed to by path

themes
------
This is meant to simplify synchronizing the themes of many different programs
symbolic links are used to link the the correct file to use as a theme
the themes/current_theme is symbolically linked to the current theme then inside
the current_theme directory there are *.theme links to the actual theme to use

the themes/.resources folder is used to store a bunch of resources that can be used
to construct the themes

all the layers of symbolic links can make things confusing though like for example conky is probably the worst
.conkyrc -> ~/.files/link/conkyrc -> ~/.files/themes/current_theme/conky.theme -> ~/.files/themes/solarized_dark/conky.theme -> ~/.files/themes/.resources/conky/conky_simple

somehow things are simpler anyway as long as you know whats going on. things could be made simpler by copying say the conky_simple file into the solarized_dark/conky.theme but I'd prefer to use git submodules for several of the resources so I can't just check the conky_simple file in with a different_name in a different place without a symlink

hidden files are also everywhere to keep clutter to a minimum. If it's unlikely something will ever be edited or a directory will ever actually need to be browsed then it is a hidden file. This hopefully will keep the settings and the stuff needed to make everything work seperate
