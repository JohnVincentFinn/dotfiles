dotfiles
========

These are the dotfiles that I use


.files
`|- global              - should be sourced to get the locations of the other dotfiles
 |- link                - files that should be linked to the ~ directory
 |- install             
 |- scripts             - executable scripts
 |- config
 |- bashrc.d            - files that should be sourced when a new bash is started 
 `|- .public            - files that should be shared on github
  |- .local             - files that should not be shared because of machine specific settings
